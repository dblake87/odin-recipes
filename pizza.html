        <h2>Easy Cheese & Tomato Pizza</h2>

        <p>Easy to make cheese & tomato pizza receipe that the whole family will enjoy!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>150 ml Water warm</li>
        <li>1 tsp Sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp Yeast</li>
        <li>1 tsp Salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Pizza Sauce</li>
        <li>100g Mozarella Cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl mix the warm water with the sugar and yeast and leave to rest for 10 minutes to allow the yeast will activate – when the yeast has activated the mixture should be foamy and there should be small bubbles forming at the top</li>
        <li>In a large bowl add the flour, salt, olive and the yeast mixture then mix until combined before transferring to the worktop and kneading for a further 8-10 minutes</li>
        <li>Oil the bowl and transfer the dough into it then cover the dough with clingfilm and leave to rest for at least 1 hour to allow it to rise – preferably overnight to allow the yeast to ferment and create more flavour</li>
        <li>When the dough has proofed flour the worktop sparingly and transfer the dough on then kneed for 2-3 minutes</li>
        <li>Split the dough into two equal parts and create a smooth ball with each part – at this point it is also a good time to turn on the oven 200°C (400°F) gas mark 6 to allow it to preheat</li>
        <li>With each dough ball use your hands to press down and outwards to create a circular base – do not use a rolling pin as this will push all the air out giving a tough base</li>
        <li>Transfer the pizza bases onto 12-inch pizza pans</li>
        <li>Use a ladle to spread the pizza sauce leaving approximately 1cm around the edge to create a crust then add the cheese – if you would like to add more toppings then add them on top of the cheese now</li>
        <li>Bake at the top of the oven for 10-15 minutes until the cheese is golden brown</li>
        <li>Serve with crispy French fries and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
