        <p>Easy garlic bread that is a tasty starter!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        
        <ul>
        <li>1 loaf French or Italian bread (approx. 24" long)</li>
        <li>6 Tbsp butter, room temperature</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp garlic bread</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Instructions</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400ÂºF. In a bowl, stir together the room-temperature butter, olive oil, minced garlic, garlic powder, chopped parsley, and salt until relatively smooth (a few small lumps of butter are okay)</li>
        <li>Cut the loaf in half, into two 12" long pieces, then cut each piece open lengthwise. Lay the bread on a baking sheet cut sides facing up. Spread the garlic butter mixture evenly over the open surfaces of the bread.</li>
        <li>Bake the bread for 10-15 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and crispy. Bake for less time if you prefer a softer garlic bread, and more time if you prefer a crispier garlic bread. Cut the bread into 2-inch sections and serve hot.</li>


    </ol>
